	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// syncCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// syncCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
